[o] cluster
[x]   connections to multiple servers
[x]   write to all
[x]   read round robin. solved by the load balancer.
[x]   file with ips of cluster nodes

[x]   index on the referring field for delete ... where
[ ] Db.instance().makeConsistent() deleting RefN orphans, setting null on missing Ref etc 
[ ] Db.instance().delete(Index) Db.instance().create(Index) for faster imports?
